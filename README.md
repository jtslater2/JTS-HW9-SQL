Finally, we are asked to create a series of database searches to find the following:

\1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

\2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

\3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
